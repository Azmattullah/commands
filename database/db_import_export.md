Got it 👍 — your current command **exports (dumps)** a MySQL database from a remote host to your local machine.

You want to **import (restore)** a database *from the remote host* instead — that means you’ll connect to the remote host, **dump the database there**, and **pipe it directly into a local MySQL import**.

Here’s how you can optimize that:

---

### ✅ **Option 1: Direct Import via SSH Pipe (recommended)**

If you have SSH access to the remote server:

```bash
ssh azmat@13.203.184.168 "mysqldump -u azmat -p database_db" | mysql -u localuser -p local_database
```

**Explanation:**

* The `ssh` command runs `mysqldump` on the remote server.
* The dump output is piped (`|`) directly into your **local** `mysql` command.
* You’ll be asked for two passwords:

  * One for the SSH connection (if using password auth).
  * One for the local MySQL user.

This avoids creating an intermediate `.sql` file — faster and more secure.

---

### ✅ **Option 2: Import from a saved dump file**

If you already have the dump file saved locally (e.g. `mydatabase_dump2025-10-25.sql`):

```bash
mysql -u localuser -p local_database < /home/linux711/Desktop/mydatabase_dump2025-10-25.sql
```

---

### ✅ **Option 3: Import directly from remote MySQL (no SSH)**

If port 3306 (MySQL) is open on the remote host and you can connect directly:

```bash
mysqldump -u azmat -h 13.203.184.168 -p database_db | mysql -u localuser -p local_database
```

**Explanation:**

* Dumps directly from the remote MySQL server over TCP.
* Pipes it immediately into the local MySQL import.

⚠️ **Note:** This exposes the database dump over the network — make sure you trust the connection or use SSL.

Would you like me to tailor the command for **importing into a remote server instead** (i.e., push your local DB *to* the remote)?

Got it 👍 — you want to **pull a database from the remote host** and **save it as a `.sql` dump file locally**, instead of directly importing it into your local database.

That means you’ll still use `mysqldump`, but direct its output into a local `.sql` file.

---

### ✅ **Command (Export remote DB → Save to local .sql file)**

```bash
mysqldump -u azmat -h 13.203.184.168 -p database_db > /home/linux711/Desktop/mydatabase_dump_$(date +%F).sql
```

---

But — wait — that’s *already* what your original command does.
So if you meant you **can’t run `mysqldump` locally because the remote host blocks it**, and instead you want to **SSH in and dump remotely**, then pipe it down, use this version:

---

### ✅ **Optimized: Export remote DB via SSH → Save locally**

```bash
ssh azmat@13.203.184.168 "mysqldump -u azmat -p database_db" > /home/linux711/Desktop/mydatabase_dump_$(date +%F).sql
```

**Explanation:**

* The dump runs **on the remote server** (no direct DB connection needed from your machine).
* The `.sql` file is **saved locally** on your desktop.
* You’ll be prompted twice:

  1. SSH password (for remote access)
  2. MySQL password (for the remote DB user `azmat`)

---

### ✅ Optional: Compress while dumping

To save bandwidth and space:

```bash
ssh azmat@13.203.184.168 "mysqldump -u azmat -p database_db | gzip" > /home/linux711/Desktop/mydatabase_dump_$(date +%F).sql.gz
```

Then later you can restore with:

```bash
gunzip < mydatabase_dump_2025-10-25.sql.gz | mysql -u localuser -p local_database
```

---

Would you like me to include an example that skips password prompts (using a `.my.cnf` config file or environment variable)?

Here’s your documentation in the proper format 👇

---

# Import database dump to localhost

```bash
mysql -u azmat -p database_db < mydatabase_dump$(date +%F).sql
```

# Export database dump from remote host

```bash
mysqldump -u azmat -h 13.203.184.168 -p database_db > /home/linux711/Desktop/mydatabase_dump$(date +%F).sql
```

---

Would you like me to add **the reverse example** (importing from remote or exporting from localhost)?
